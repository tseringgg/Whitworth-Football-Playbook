Project Name: Whitworth Football Play Diagram Generator

Description:
- This project is an automated computer software program that allows Whitworth football to be more time efficient and productive. This piece of software creates diagrams of weekly plays that  Whitworth football will use against its opponents. It will eliminate the need of Coaches to individually create each play from scratch each week and allow that time to be spent on something else giving Whitworth football a possible game winning advantage. 

Specifics on the Process:
- Each play that is going to be ran is put onto a call sheet. The call sheet is a piece of paper that the offensive coordinator holds and gives them all of their plays to be called at any individual moment. The call sheets are put into an excel doc that way they can be changed if needed. Once the call sheet is finished, it is on the coaches to then start plugging away on the diagramming of the plays. These playbook drawings are done through a graphic design software called ‘Visio’. Visio allows us to be able to be able to add shapes and lines in addition to text boxes. The text box at the top of the sheet holds each play name, while the shapes and lines allow us to diagram the specifics of each play. Specifics may include the given formation, concepts, blocking scheme, route concept, and play progression listings. 

The Problem Worth Solving:
- As mentioned, the time spent drawing up each individual play for the week takes a lot of time, around 10 hours per week to be exact. With time being extremely limited and valuable during any given game week for a coach, a way to speed up this process would be extremely valuable. It would give much more free time to all coaches on staff to be able to dive deeper into their opponents and continue to study for weak points in an opposing defense. This work is currently done through manual labor and precise mouse-clicking. If there were to be a way to automate this process by allowing a computer software to create the diagrams for us, much time would be freed for the coaches. This added time in the day could be used to host player meetings, study sessions, recruiting opportunities, and maybe even allow a coach to head home a tad early once in a while. 

Obstacles Encountered / Solutions:
- Water mark
    - Small enough to work around & also can delete watermark when pdf is transferred to Visio
- Lack of access to frameworks and packages to work with
    - Took a lot of our time to research to find something we can utilize
    - Found only one option that would work for our project, but the entire framework included many services so it was expensive ($5,000)
- Lack access to visio
    - We didn't have access to the Visio services as students here so we had to work with our client to get work within Visio on desktops and on Whitworth Football's account
- Database issues
    - Figure out how to store our data - Didn't want to pay for a cloud service to store data
        - Considered MySQL and mdf files
        - Realizes our data wouldn't change for the most part so JSON files with all the would suffice

Successes:
- Designed extensively - testable and dynamic
    - In the future, can add objects or other features to the play easily
