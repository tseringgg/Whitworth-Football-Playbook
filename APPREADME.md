Whitworth Football Play Diagram Generator
This project is an automated computer software program that allows Whitworth football to be more time efficient and productive. This piece of software creates diagrams of weekly plays that  Whitworth football will use against its opponents. It will eliminate the need of Coaches to individually create each play from scratch each week and allow that time to be spent on something else giving Whitworth football a possible game winning advantage. 

How to use the Whitworth Football Play Diagram Generator
The Whitworth Football Play Diagram Generator takes in a excel file of plays to generate a pdf file of catagorized plays. When the play diagram generator is started, you will be prompted with a file explorer. With this explorer, you will need to select the weekly playsheet of the plays you want generated into a diagram.

Formating the Excel file of plays
The format of the excel file is important so the program knows where to get all of the information. Some important features for the program are the title of a new catagory and the plays themselves. The catagory of plays should be in the first collumn where you want a new catagory to start. The rest of the rows should be empty as any play information in the same row as a catagory will be missed by the program.
For an example of the format, see the provided example.
